## Firefox Custom Stylesheets

A custom Firefox stylesheet that makes my Firefox looks better. It is supposed to be working with the plugin [Tree Style Tab](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tree-style-tab/)

In short, it will 

- Remove top tab bar (for the vertical tab)
- Shrink vertical tab, and only expands on hover
- On Windows, it will show nice color buttons to replace the default close, minimize, maximize buttons, reference from KDE Sweet theme
- And some other mini theming which sometimes mess with the overall looks, but things work

The files should be placed in something like `/home/shenyien/.mozilla/firefox/r45ynehc.default-release` that you can find from `about:profiles`

Also, don't forget to enable legacy stylesheet settings in `about:configs`

It will look like this:

## Tree Style Tab Options

Import the `treestyletab.css` into the Tree Style Tab Custom CSS, and set theme to proton
