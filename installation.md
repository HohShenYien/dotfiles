## Installation

Not a super geek here, gave up manual installation after trying it once (successful, but took more than 1 hour)

GUI Installer: [ALG](https://sourceforge.net/projects/arch-linux-gui/) (Might wanna switch mirror to speed it up)

- 500MB for `/boot/efi` (FAT32)
- The rest goes to `/`

Some other must do configurations:

- Update Pacman mirrors to Singapore
